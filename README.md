This repository consists of the APS105 Labs and my approach to them.

**Important Notice: Please Read**

This GitHub repository contains my personal coursework and lab assignments for my computer programming course. It is intended to showcase my skills, knowledge, and coding abilities to potential employers or individuals interested in my work.

I have worked diligently on these projects, and I kindly request that you respect the following guidelines:

1. **Do not plagiarize**: This repository is not meant to be copied or submitted as your own work for any academic or professional purposes. Plagiarism is a serious offense that violates academic integrity policies, and it can have severe consequences.

2. **Use it as a reference only**: Feel free to browse through the code, learn from it, and gain insights into various programming concepts. However, make sure to apply your own understanding and skills when working on your own coursework or projects.

Remember, learning and growth come from individual effort and understanding. Plagiarism not only undermines personal development but also compromises the integrity of academic and professional communities.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspects of my work, please feel free to contact me.
